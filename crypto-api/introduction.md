# Introduction

Welcome to the Abyiss Centralized Exchange API Documentation! This section of our documentation covers everything related to centralized exchanges, including supported exchanges, REST APIs, Websockets, market data, reference data, historical data, pagination, return types, and more.

To get started, you'll need to create an account and API key with Abyiss. This will allow you to access our endpoints and start building your applications with our centralized exchange data. You can create an account by [clicking the link here](https://abyiss.com/signin), and learn more about [API Keys and Authorization](../introduction/api-architecture/api-keys-authentication.md) by clicking the link provided here.

Some of the important endpoints available through our API include:

* [Market Data](broken-reference): Access real-time and historical market data from our supported exchanges
* [Reference Data](references/): Retrieve information about supported exchanges, trading pairs, and more
* [Websockets](websockets/): Subscribe to real-time updates on market data and other information
* [Historical Data](references/historical-data.md): Retrieve historical market data for analysis and backtesting
* [Pagination](references/pagination.md): Learn how to increase API response data limit using pagination
* [Return Types](references/return-types.md): Understand the different data formats and structures returned by our API endpoints

We hope this documentation will serve as a helpful resource as you work with our centralized exchange API. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact our [support team](https://abyiss.com/contact).
