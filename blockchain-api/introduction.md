## Get Started

Welcome to the Abyiss decentralized Exchange API Documentation! This section of our documentation covers everything related to centralized exchanges, including supported exchanges, REST APIs, Websockets, historical data, query parameters, error handling, return types, and more.

To get started, you'll need to create an account and API key with Abyiss. This will allow you to access our endpoints and start building your applications with our decentralized exchange data. You can create an account by [clicking the link here](https://abyiss.com/signin), and learn more about [API Keys and Authorization](../introduction/api-architecture/api-keys-authentication.md) by clicking the link provided here.

Some of the important endpoints available through our API include:

* [REST APIs](rest-apis/): Access real-time and historical market data and reference data from our supported exchanges
* [Websockets](websockets/): Subscribe to real-time updates on market data and other information
* [Historical Data](references/historical-data.md): Retrieve historical market data for analysis and backtesting
* [Query Parameters](references/query-parameters.md): Modify the behavior of an API request and can be used to filter, sort, or paginate the response data
* [Error Handling](references/error-handling.md): Information on how to handle errors that may occur when making requests to our API.

We hope this documentation will serve as a helpful resource as you work with our centralized exchange API. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact our [support team](https://abyiss.com/contact).
