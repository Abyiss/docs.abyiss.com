# Changelog

## Release Version 2.2.4 - 7/12/23

We are delighted to announce the latest milestone in our continual efforts to provide a more robust, efficient and user-friendly experience for our customers - the upgrade to our /v2 API.

Here's what this update entails:

* /v2 API Upgrade: As part of our ongoing commitment to keep Abyiss at the forefront of technology and user experience, we've now upgraded all of our /v1 API endpoints to /v2. This move is aimed to equip developers with a more powerful and streamlined platform that delivers faster responses, improved performance, and offers advanced features.
* Seamless Transition: To minimize disruptions to your applications, the upgrade process has been designed to be smooth and seamless. You'll find that all your familiar endpoints now have an equivalent in /v2, with identical functionality but enhanced performance and capability.
* Backward Compatibility: We understand the importance of backward compatibility and have ensured that your existing applications working with our /v1 APIs will continue to function properly as you transition to /v2. However, we encourage all users to migrate their applications to take advantage of the enhancements that /v2 offers.
* Enhanced Error Handling: As part of the /v2 upgrade, we've significantly improved our error handling capabilities. You'll now receive more accurate and detailed error responses, which will help you debug issues more efficiently.
* Documentation Update: Our documentation has been revised to reflect these changes, and now includes a comprehensive guide on transitioning from /v1 to /v2. We recommend that all developers review the updated documentation to familiarize themselves with the new endpoints and features.

We are confident that this upgrade will provide developers with a more dynamic and efficient way to build applications on Abyiss. We encourage your feedback and suggestions on the new /v2 APIs and remain committed to serving your needs. As always, thank you for your continued support and trust in our platform.

## Release Version 2.2.3 - 3/22/23

We are excited to announce the release of our newest APIs that will allow developers to integrate with Abyiss.&#x20;

Here are the latest changes and updates we made:

* New DEX APIs: We have added a set of new APIs to our platform that enables developers to interact with decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. With these APIs, developers can access various functionalities, including real-time and historical token data, checking liquidity pool status, getting trading history, and more.
* Improved functionality: Our development team has worked hard to improve the overall functionality of our platform. We have made several enhancements to the existing APIs, including better error handling and more detailed response messages.
