We are excited to share some major updates that we plan to roll out in the coming weeks. Here's a sneak peek at what's in store:

* **WebSockets**: We are working on adding WebSockets support to our APIs. This will enable real-time data streaming and push notifications, providing users with a more seamless and efficient trading experience.

* **More Reference Data Endpoints**: We plan to expand our reference data endpoints to include more comprehensive data on trading pairs, exchanges, and assets.
* **More Market Data Endpoints**: Additionally, we are adding more market data endpoints to provide users with access to real-time and historical data on trading volumes, price movements, and more.
* **On-Chain Data**: We will be introducing new endpoints that allow developers to access and analyze on-chain data, providing deeper insights into blockchain networks and decentralized applications.
  * **Wallet Data & Tracking**: We are developing new APIs that will enable users to track wallet balances and transactions across multiple blockchains.
  * **Money In-Flows & Out-Flows**: Our platform will soon provide data on money flows into and out of exchanges and wallets, helping traders and investors to better understand market sentiment.
  * **Support for Multiple Cryptocurrencies**: We are expanding our platform to include support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Stable Coins, Binance Coin (BNB), Solana, and more.

We are committed to continuously improving and expanding our APIs to meet the evolving needs of our users. Stay tuned for more updates in the coming weeks!
